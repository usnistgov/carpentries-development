## Resources for Performance Python

These resources were ID'd in early December of 2021, and
are possible starting points for high-performance
Python lessons.  

The expectation is that this material is probably not
immediately teachable, but is possibly useful in 
developing lesson content that meets our needs.

As presented, these are mainly intended for notebook
or desktop execution, and may need additional work
to adapt them to an HPC context. 

 - [Numba tutorials][numbatut] from the official Numba 
   documentation. The tutorial links are towards the
   bottom of the page, and are a mix of videos and notebooks.
 - [Xarray tutorial][xarraytut] from the Xarray GitHub site.
   Xarray is a distributed data container that can accommodate
   indexed and labeled data.
 - [Dask tutorial][dasktut] from the official Dask site.  
   Includes a unit on machine learning, which might 
   enlarge and/or skew the audience.
 - [Blog post][coildask] about Dask, with a thorough-looking
   collection of video and code resources.
 - [Cython tutorial][cythontut] from the official site,
   with a generous amount of content in ReadTheDocs text
   format and cut-and-paste-able code blocks.
