## FAIR principles

What does FAIR even mean? The following sections reproduce the
summary from [FAIR4RS][fair4rs], based on the original
[FAIR paper][fair].

[FAIR-Aware tool][fair-aware]!

### Findable

The first step in (re)using software is to find it. Metadata and
software should be easy to find for both humans and computers.
Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of
software, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification
process.

1. Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.
2. Software is described with rich metadata (defined first by R1
   below, and then by the original FAIR principles for metadata).
3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the
   software they describe.
4. Software is registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

### Accessible

Once the user finds the required software, they need to know how it
can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorization.

1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardized
   communications protocol.
   1. The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
   2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization
      procedure, where necessary.
2. Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer
   available.

### Interoperable

The software usually needs to communicate with other software via
exchanged data (or possibly its metadata). Software tools can
interoperate via common support for the data they exchange.

1. Software should read, write or exchange data in a way that meets
   domain-relevant community standards.
2. Software includes qualified references to other objects.

### Reusable

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to enable and encourage the use and
reuse of software. To achieve this, software should be well-described
(by metadata) and appropriately structured so that it can be
replicated, combined, reinterpreted, reimplemented, and/or used in
different settings.

1. Software is richly described with a plurality of accurate and
   relevant attributes.
   1. Software is made available with a clear and accessible software
      usage license.
   2. Software is associated with detailed provenance.
   3. Software meets domain-relevant community standards.
2. Software includes qualified references to other software.

## Make It FAIR in Ten Easy Steps

[Library Carpentry][lc] has a summary of [10 "easy" steps to make your
software FAIR][lc-fair-poster] (PDF). An annotated list follows.

1. *Create a description of your software.*  
   Write this in `README.md` with supporting tables, charts, images,
   etc. Include its dependencies, installation instructions, and
   citations of any work it builds upon.
2. *Register your software in a software registry.*  
   [MIDAS][midas] is the go-to where Data Sponsorship is concerned,
   but is not the only option.
3. *Use a unique and persistent identifier for your software.*  
   Any registry compliant with [NIST O 5702][o5702] will provide you
   with a persistent handle.
4. *Make sure that people can download your software.*  
   If the data is fire- or pay-walled, provide an alternative site.
   Wherever your data lives, check back from time to time to make
   sure the links are still valid.
5. *Explain the functionality of your software.*  
   Write this into a "Usage" section of `README.md`, or similar,
   with example of how to configure, launch, and interact with the
   software, with examples of output to be expected.
6. *Use standard (community-agreed) formats for inputs and outputs.*  
   While open standards are preferred, if a proprietary format is the
   *lingua franca* of the field, focus on that. Create open versions
   if possible.
7. *Document your software.*  
    This goes beyond `README.md` and in-line comments. Place
    documentation, or its build scripts, in a folder named `doc` with
    its own `README.md` describing how to build the docs and what to
    expect.
8. *Give your software a license.*  
   If all members of the development team are Federal employees, use
   the standard NIST Disclaimer of Copyright and Warranty for your
   [LICENSE.md][disc-copy]. Otherwise, decide on an appropriate
   license.
9. *State how to cite your software.*  
   This can be done in `README.md`, or as a separate `CITATION.md`
   using a BiBTeX-styled code block.
10. *Follow best practices for software development.*  
   Broadly speaking, this starts with version control using
   [git][git] or similar, [linting][lint] your code, and following
   some type of branching workflow when multiple developers are
   involved. The regularly-scheduled Software Carpentry workshops at
   NIST teach the basics of some of these concepts.

## What's good enough?

[*Good enough practices in scientific computing*][gepsc] is an
excellent paper outlining what you need to do to produce good science
in a FAIR frame of mind. *tl;dr* follows.

### Data management

1. Save the raw data.
2. Ensure that raw data are backed up in more than one location.
3. Create the data you wish to see in the world.
4. Create analysis-friendly data.
5. Record all the steps used to process data.
6. Anticipate the need to use multiple tables, and use a unique
   identifier for every record.
7. Submit data to a reputable DOI-issuing repository so that others
   can access and cite it.

### Software

1. Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program.
2. Decompose programs into functions.
3. Be ruthless about eliminating duplication.
4. Always search for well-maintained software libraries that do what
   you need.
5. Test libraries before relying on them.
6. Give functions and variables meaningful names.
7. Make dependencies and requirements explicit.
8. Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to control a
   program's behavior.
9. Provide a simple example or test data set.
10. Submit code to a reputable DOI-issuing repository.

### Collaboration

1. Create an overview of your project.
2. Create a shared "to-do" list for the project.
3. Decide on communication strategies.
4. Make the license explicit.
5. Make the project citable.

### Project organization

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the
   project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc`
   directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in a `data` directory and files generated
   during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
4. Put project source code in the `src` directory.
5. Put external scripts or compiled programs in the `bin` directory.
6. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

### Keeping track of changes

1. Back up (almost) everything created by a human being as soon as it
   is created.
2. Keep changes small.
3. Share changes frequently.
4. Create, maintain, and use a checklist for saving and sharing
   changes to the project.
5. Store each project in a folder that is mirrored off the
   researcher's working machine.
6. Add a file called `CHANGELOG.md` to the project's docs subfolder.
7. Copy the entire project whenever a significant change has been
   made.
8. Use a version control system.

### Manuscripts

1. Write manuscripts using online tools with rich formatting, change
   tracking, and reference management.
2. Write the manuscript in a plain text format that permits version
   control.
